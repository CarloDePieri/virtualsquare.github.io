New vde\_plug: `vdesl`.

This vde\_plug creates a virtual point to point ethernet link over a serial line.

Example: connect the uart ports of two Raspberry PI boards (GND-\>GND, TXD-\>RXD, RXD-\>TXD).

The following command (on both RasPIs):
```bash
       sudo vde_plug -d tap://vdesl0 vdesl:///dev/ttyAMA0[speed=4000000]
```

creates a 4Mbps ethernet link connecting the two `vdesl0` interfaces.
