**_all the virtuality you always wanted but you were afraid to ask_**

Welcome to Virtual Square wiki (2.0)! We are currently rewriting the entire
codebase of the VirtualSquare. We have almost completed the task.

Here you'll find almost everything you need to know to get started using
Virtual Square suite of tools and software. Remember that the software
presented in this Wiki is produced by a research project and so the latest
developments are extremely experimental.
